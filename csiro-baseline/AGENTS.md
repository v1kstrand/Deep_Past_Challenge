# Collaboration Guidelines

## 1) Bullet keys for clarity
When you provide **Findings**, **Questions**, **Lists**, or any multi-item bullets, prefix **each item** with a **unique key**. (OBS you can use any "keys" as bullets (*, -, ints. etc), not limited to
"
a1)... 
a2)...
"

Example:

Findings  
a1) ...  
a2) ...  

Questions  
b1) ...  
b2) ...  

Rules:
- Keys only need to be unique **within the current message**.
- Keys may be reused in later messages.

## 2) Code gating with flags
I will control whether you write code using these flags:

- **(no code)**: Do not implement or output new code. Only discuss, explain, review, or ask/answer questions.
- **(code ok)**: Code is allowed.

If a message includes **(no code)**, wait until I explicitly send **(code ok)** before you start implementing.

## 3) Plan-first implementation
Even when I send **(code ok)**, do **not** start coding immediately.

Process:
- First, provide a **high-level implementation plan** (steps + files/functions to touch).
- Then wait for my approval/adjustments.
- Only after I approve the plan should you write or modify code.
